An addon for the Terraria mod The Stars Above, and a full overhaul of its 1.3 predecessor, UnforgottenBuffed.
![Demonstration](https://github.com/WilliamOu/SpiritBlossom/blob/main/Demonstration/Demo.gif)

# Description 
Discover the Spirit Blossom swords and embrace the power of Yone from League of Legends in Terraria! Craft these elegant and lethal weapons using the Unforgotten from Stars Above, and experience a true-to-form recreation of Yone’s abilities, now fully revamped and updated for Terraria 1.4.

A complete overhaul over previous versions, this mod is a true port of the character, bringing all of Yone’s iconic attacks, abilities, and stunning rotoscoped effects straight into your world. High risk, high reward; strike swiftly with his signature high-mobility moves and rushdown damage, but be prepared to master the swords' limited true melee range! Ready to challenge the Moon Lord with the full arsenal of our favorite Demon Hunter abilities?

And with precise timing and ingenuity, you’ll not only dominate pre-Moon Lord challenges but discover immense post-Moon Lord utility, making these swords a valuable companion even as you progress into modded Terraria’s endgame.

# Updates
I spent most of my summer developing this mod, mostly as a for-fun project. As such, It's likely to not be updated as I will be busy with other commitments. Further development will likely be limited to bug fixes and balance changes, and potentially sprite sheet updates if I find the time.

# Known Issues
The mod is currently not multiplayer compatible, and various effects like Enhanced Mortal Steel's knockup, Soul Unbound's Death Mark, and Fate Sealed's pull cause enemies to disappear, among other odd side effects.
